This file contains future things to add for usability and for more things to implement as I need them. This list is
in no particular order.

*** always need to work on improving documentation ***
(1) Make the GUI more usable:
    (a) add submenus for all of the options
    (b) add some short descriptions of what the different plotting
        functions are.
    (c) eventually add the ability for user defined operations from the GUI
    (d) prototype (c) in the CLI first

(2) New functions
    (a) improve the knock detection algorithm to make use of the FKL (fine knock learning) as well
    (b) improve the knock detection algorithm to also show knock relative frequency, which we will want to
        minimize
    (c) Determine when knock is occurring:
          (i) ie in open loop / closed loop
          (ii) ie see if there are certain underlying conditions related to AFR or tip-in
          (iii) frequency of knock events vs different common conditions (low load, WOT, tip-in)
          (iv) Maybe find some very knocky data to use to set some safety limits based off of

    (d) Include a function that takes in standard values/map data from COBB AccessTuner and suggest edits/improvements
        based on the given current data. Need to start keeping information on different iterations of tune and corresponding logfiles

    (e) create seperate routine to consolidate data into single csv files per iteration of tune for (d)
    (f) create functionality to let user do said csv file creation
    (g) come up with new data filtering techniques to remove common noise/ highly repetative condition. Basically prune
        out highly replicated data to save storage space
    (h) look at parameter values in AccessTuner, to determine to state space and use to decide when the given logfiles
        are a good representation of all possible driving conditions (ie span at least a wide range of load, RPM,
        and varying temperature values)
    (i) Perform some modular operation between varying log files to find common underlying noise (Kalmann
    filtering) to determine what is environmental and sensor based noises
