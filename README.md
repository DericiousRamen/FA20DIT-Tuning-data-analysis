For background information on this project and this repository as a whole, please read this post.( https://www.reddit.com/r/WRX/comments/ku077y/been_working_on_tuning_my_own_car/ ) Also, this project is in development as of now 
and there will be more work done on it. I plan to post regularly as I work on this and post updates on the r/WRX subreddit. This repo may not always be up to date and I make no promises that this software will help you at all. Use 
this at your own risk. I highly recommend reading up on the COBB support website before making any changes to your particular tune here: https://cobbtuning.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRS/pages/28705206/SUBARU+ACCESSTUNER+SUPPORT. 

As of now, this project is primarily as CLI program with the functions discussed in the original reddit post. I'll update this more when this is more developed and I have time.
